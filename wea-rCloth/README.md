    Use pandas for data manipulation.
    Visualize with Matplotlib & Seaborn (pie, bar, line, scatter plots).
    Identify trends in usage, style, and preference.

4. User Interface (Streamlit)

    Add, edit, and filter clothing items.
    Generate outfits and collect feedback dynamically.
    Display wardrobe insights interactively.

✨ Novelty of Work in Kyrgyzstan

Wea-rCloth is the first structured digital wardrobe assistant developed in Kyrgyzstan. It combines weather-conscious outfit planning with local style preferences, unlike any existing solution. It allows user ratings, tracks wardrobe data, and is tailored to local seasonal trends, setting it apart from generic fashion apps.
